# NANDA Project Papers

This repository contains six key papers outlining the architectural, strategic, and technical foundations of the NANDA (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI) initiative at MIT Media Lab. Each document contributes uniquely to the vision of the Internet of Agents.

## 1. [A Perspective on Decentralizing AI](decentralized_ML_perspective-16.pdf)

Outlines five foundational challenges for decentralized AI systems: privacy, verifiability, incentives, orchestration, and user experience. The paper proposes a layered architectural approach and highlights parallels with internet infrastructure like TCP/IP and DNS.

## 2. [Game of Agents – Episode 1: Let there be Agents](Game%20of%20Agents%20%E2%80%94%20Episode%201_%20Let%20there%20be%20Agents%20_%20by%20Abhishek%20Singh%20_%20Medium.pdf)

Introduces the rise of intelligent agents from early LLM tooling to multi-agent systems. It discusses protocol evolution, especially the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and sets the stage for emerging agent infrastructure battles.

## 3. [Game of Agents – Episode 2: The Great Library of Alexandria 2.0](Game%20of%20Agents%20%E2%80%94%20Episode%202_%20The%20Great%20Library%20of%20Alexandria%202.0%20_%20by%20Abhishek%20Singh%20_%20Medium.pdf)

Explores the need for an agent registry to enable discovery, trust, and collaboration among dynamic and ephemeral AI agents. Compares governance models including platform-led, consortium-led, and decentralized blockchain-based approaches.

## 4. [Scaling Trust Beyond DNS – NANDA Registry](Scaling%20Trust%20Beyond%20DNS%20-%20How%20NANDA%20Registry%20and%20Verified%20AgentFacts%20Unlock%20the%20Internet%20of%20AI%20Agents.pdf)

Details the design of a minimal, privacy-preserving registry architecture for agent discovery. Introduces the AgentFacts schema, TTL-based endpoint resolution, and cryptographic verification for agent capabilities.

---

## 5. [Upgrade or Switch – The Need for New Registry](Upgrade%20or%20Switch%20-%20The%20Need%20for%20New%20Registry%20Architecture%20for%20the%20Internet%20of%20AI%20Agents.pdf)

Analyzes the limitations of DNS and web infrastructure for agentic systems. Compares extending current systems versus building new registries. Offers historical analogies like dial-up to broadband to argue for infrastructure transition.

---

## 6. [Internet of Agents Architecture (Agentic Chat Demo)](NandaRegistry_AgenticChat.pdf)

Presents a layered architecture for live multi-agent interaction via chat interfaces. Describes client, communication, and context agent roles with example use cases. Demonstrates real-time coordination enabled by the NANDA registry.
